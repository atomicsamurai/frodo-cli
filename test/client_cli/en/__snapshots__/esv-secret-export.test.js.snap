"Usage: frodo esv secret export [options] [host] [username] [password]

Export secrets.

Arguments:
  host                         Access Management base URL, e.g.:
                               https://cdk.iam.example.com/am. To use a
                               connection profile, just specify a unique
                               substring.
  username                     Username to login with. Must be an admin user
                               with appropriate rights to manage authentication
                               journeys/trees.
  password                     Password.

Options:
  -a, --all                    Export all secrets to a single file. Ignored
                               with -i.
  -A, --all-separate           Export all sub1s to separate files
                               (*.secret.json) in the current directory.
                               Ignored with -i or -a.
  --curlirize                  Output all network calls in curl format.
  -D, --directory <directory>  Set the working directory.
  --debug                      Debug output during command execution. If
                               specified, may or may not produce additional
                               output helpful for troubleshooting.
  -f, --file <file>            Name of the export file.
  --flush-cache                Flush token cache.
  -h, --help                   Help
  -i, --secret-id <secret-id>  Secret id. If specified, -a and -A are ignored.
  --include-active-values      Include the currently active (and loaded) secret
                               value in the export. By default, secret values
                               are encrypted server-side in the environment
                               they are exported from. Use --target <host url>
                               to have another environment perform the
                               encryption.
  -k, --insecure               Allow insecure connections when using SSL/TLS.
                               Has no effect when using a network proxy for
                               https (HTTPS_PROXY=http://<host>:<port>), in
                               that case the proxy must provide this
                               capability. (default: Don't allow insecure
                               connections)
  -m, --type <type>            Override auto-detected deployment type. Valid
                               values for type:
                               classic:  A classic Access Management-only
                               deployment with custom layout and configuration.
  
                               cloud:    A ForgeRock Identity Cloud
                               environment.
                               forgeops: A ForgeOps CDK or CDM deployment.
                               The detected or provided deployment type
                               controls certain behavior like obtaining an
                               Identity Management admin token or not and
                               whether to export/import referenced email
                               templates or how to walk through the tenant
                               admin login flow of Identity Cloud and handle
                               MFA (choices: "classic", "cloud", "forgeops")
  -N, --no-metadata            Does not include metadata in the export file.
  --no-cache                   Disable token cache for this operation.
  --sa-id <sa-id>              Service account id.
  --sa-jwk-file <file>         File containing the JSON Web Key (JWK)
                               associated with the the service account.
  --target <host url>          Host URL of the environment to perform secret
                               value encryption. The URL must resolve to an
                               existing connection profile. Use this option to
                               generate an export that can be imported into the
                               target environment without requiring admin
                               access to the source environment.
  --verbose                    Verbose output during command execution. If
                               specified, may or may not produce additional
                               output.

[92mHow Frodo handles secrets:
[39m[92m  Frodo supports exporting and importing of ESV secret values. To leave stuartship of secret values with the cloud environment where they belong, frodo always encrypts values using either encryption keys from the source environment (default) or the target environment (--target parameter). Frodo never exports secrets in the clear.

[39mUsage Examples:
  Export secrets including active secret values to a single file (Note: only values of active and loaded secrets can be exported):
[96m  $ frodo esv secret export -a --include-active-values matrix
[39m  Export secrets including active secret values to individual files in a directory (Note: only values of active and loaded secrets can be exported):
[96m  $ frodo esv secret export -A -D matrix-secrets --include-active-values matrix
[39m  Export secrets including active secret values to a single file for import into another environment.
  The --target parameter instructs frodo to encrypt the exported secret values using the target environment so they can be imported into that target environment without requiring the source environment they were exported from.
  Using the --target parameter, the target environment must be available at the time of export and the person performing the export must have a connection profile for the target environment.
  Without the --target parameter, the source environment must be available at the time of import and the person performing the import must have a connection profile for the source environment.
[96m  $ frodo esv secret export -a --include-active-values --target zion matrix
