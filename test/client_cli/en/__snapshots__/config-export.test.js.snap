"Usage: frodo config export [options] [host] [realm] [username] [password]

Export full cloud configuration for all ops that currently support export.

Arguments:
  host                         Access Management base URL, e.g.:
                               https://cdk.iam.example.com/am. To use a
                               connection profile, just specify a unique
                               substring.
  realm                        Realm. Specify realm as '/' for the root realm
                               or 'realm' or '/parent/child' otherwise.
                               (default: "alpha" for Identity Cloud tenants,
                               "/" otherwise.)
  username                     Username to login with. Must be an admin user
                               with appropriate rights to manage authentication
                               journeys/trees.
  password                     Password.

  -a, --all                    Export everything to a single file.
  -A, --all-separate           Export everything to separate files in the -D
                               directory. Ignored with -a.
  --curlirize                  Output all network calls in curl format.
  -d, --default                Export all scripts including the default
                               scripts.
  -D, --directory <directory>  Set the working directory.
  --debug                      Debug output during command execution. If
                               specified, may or may not produce additional
                               output helpful for troubleshooting.
  -f, --file <file>            Name of the export file.
  --flush-cache                Flush token cache.
  -h, --help                   Help
  --include-active-values      Include the currently active (and loaded) secret
                               value in the export. By default, secret values
                               are encrypted server-side in the environment
                               they are exported from. Use --target <host url>
                               to have another environment perform the
                               encryption.

                               that case the proxy must provide this
                               capability. (default: Don't allow insecure
                               connections)
  -m, --type <type>            Override auto-detected deployment type. Valid

                               deployment with custom layout and configuration.
  
                               cloud:    A ForgeRock Identity Cloud

                               Identity Management admin token or not and
                               whether to export/import referenced email
                               templates or how to walk through the tenant
                               admin login flow of Identity Cloud and handle
                               MFA (choices: "classic", "cloud", "forgeops")
  -N, --no-metadata            Does not include metadata in the export file.
  --no-cache                   Disable token cache for this operation.
  --no-coords                  Do not include the x and y coordinate positions
                               of the journey/tree nodes.

                               variable export

  --target <host url>          Host URL of the environment to perform secret
                               value encryption. The URL must resolve to an
                               existing connection profile. Use this option to
                               generate an export that can be imported into the
                               target environment without requiring admin
                               access to the source environment.
  --use-string-arrays          Where applicable, use string arrays to store
                               multi-line text (e.g. scripts). (default: off)
  --verbose                    Verbose output during command execution. If

                               output.
  -x, --extract                Extract scripts from the exported file, and save
                               it to a separate file. Ignored with -a.

[92mHow Frodo handles secrets:
[39m[92m  Frodo supports exporting and importing of ESV secret values. To leave stuartship of secret values with the cloud environment where they belong, frodo always encrypts values using either encryption keys from the source environment (default) or the target environment (--target parameter). Frodo never exports secrets in the clear.

[39mUsage Examples:
  Backup global and active realm configuration including active secret values to a single file (Note: only values of active and loaded secrets can be exported):
[96m  $ frodo config export -a --include-active-values matrix
[39m  Backup global and active realm configuration including active secret values to individual files in a directory structure (Note: only values of active and loaded secrets can be exported):
[96m  $ frodo config export -A -D matrix-backup --include-active-values matrix
[39m  Export global and active realm configuration including active secret values for import into another environment.
  The --target parameter instructs frodo to encrypt the exported secret values using the target environment so they can be imported into that target environment without requiring the source environment they were exported from.
  Using the --target parameter, the target environment must be available at the time of export and the person performing the export must have a connection profile for the target environment.
  Without the --target parameter, the source environment must be available at the time of import and the person performing the import must have a connection profile for the source environment.
[96m  $ frodo config export -a --include-active-values --target zion matrix
