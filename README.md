# Frodo Command Line Interface

A command line interface to manage PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud environments, ForgeOps deployments, and classic deployments.

Frodo is the successor to field tools like [amtree.sh](https://github.com/vscheuber/AM-treetool), [fidc-debug-tools](https://github.com/vscheuber/fidc-debug-tools), and Ping/ForgeRock-internal utilities.

Please refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli#readme) for full documentation.
